    Just my luck, no ice. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Yes, Yes, without the oops! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.<br /><br />

    Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.<br /><br />

    Life finds a way. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.<br /><br />

    Just my luck, no ice. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!<br /><br />

    God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.<br /><br />
